# Reef-space
The most amazing reef data thing ever!
## About this project

Data Reef is a collaborative project by team Futuristic Blanket regarding the issues that are currently facing many of Queensland’s natural systems.
This web app was inspired by the lack of awareness among Queenslanders about the degenerating condition of the natural ecosystems that allow us to live a comfortable life.
We hope to educate by displaying data about the change in the water quality, increase in pollution and endangered species and tidal issues caused by climate change.
It’s formatted in an interactive map intended to let clients navigate around Queensland and find important areas that are being threatened by our everyday activities.
By creating awareness, we hope to bring light to an important issue and hopefully, spark the need for change for generations now and continuing.
